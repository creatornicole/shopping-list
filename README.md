Android App that enables you to create your shopping list digitally on your smartphone
and keep track of your products at home.

The App consists of two simple lists. One for your shopping list and one for your stored products.

You will be able to add products to both lists. Moreover you can delete products from each list
and move products from one to the other.
This functionality is provided by pressing the buttons.

In addition to that the program won't add and will inform you, if you want to add a product to a list, which
is already listed. Moreover, you will get informed, if you want to add a product to the shopping list, which is
